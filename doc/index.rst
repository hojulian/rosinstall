Using rosinstall you can update several folders using a variety 
of SCMs (SVN, Mercurial, git, Bazaar) with just one command.

That way you can more effectively manage source code workspaces.

The rosinstall package provides a Python API for interacting with a
source code workspace as well as a group of command line tools.
Rosinstall leverages the :mod:`vcstools` package for source control and
stores its state in .rosinstall files.

rosinstall was developed to help with the ROS software, but it 
has no install dependencies to ROS. It offers support for ROS
environments and thus makes some assumptions about ROS being 
present at runtime, but those can be easily removed and rosws
provides all services even when there is no ROS installed. The 
vision is for the bulk of rosinstall to be a ROS agnostic 
tool one day.

    pip install -U rosinstall

or ``easy_install``:

::

    easy_install -U rosinstall vcstools

Linux and Bash users will benefit a lot from also installing bash
completion. This is provided in a different package due to the 
installation process currently requiring linux. It is only available 
via pip for now::
